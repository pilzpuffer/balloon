This project was created as part of The Odin Project course, based on the extra materials provided in the DOM Manipulation and Events lesson. 

In particular, I've completed an exercise from the "https://eloquentjavascript.net" website, lesson "Handling Events" - I was supposed to create a ballon that could be inflated, deflated and which would pop.

I've added some extra bells and whistles in the form of sound effects - otherwise, the initial goal of this exercise was met.
